NAME
    IO::Handle::Moose - Moose reimplementation of IO::Handle with
    improvements

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::Handle::Moose;

      $fh = new IO::Handle::Moose;
      $fh->fdopen(fileno(STDIN));
      print $fh->getline;
      $file = $fh->slurp;
      $fh->close;

      $fh = fdopen IO::Handle::Moose \*STDERR, '>';
      autoflush $fh 1;
      say $fh 'Some text';
      undef $fh;  # calls close at DESTROY

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides an interface mostly compatible with IO::Handler. The
    differences:

    *   It is based on Moose object framework.

    *   It uses Exception::Base for signaling errors. Most of methods are
        throwing exception on failure.

    *   The modifiers like input_record_separator are supported on
        per-filehandler basis.

    *   It also implements additional methods like say, slurp.

    *   It is pure-Perl implementation.
